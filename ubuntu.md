# Ubuntu cheatsheet

* `sudo apt-get remove _packagename_` / `sudo apt-get purge _packagename_` - Removes a package named _packagename_. This supports wildcards. I accidentally installed postgresql when I didn't need it on the server, so I was able to remove it easily with `sudo apt-get purge postgresql*`.
